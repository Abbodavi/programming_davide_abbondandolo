-define function to compute the 2 matrix
	-size m+1 *  n+1 for both
	-initialize 1° row
	-initialize 1° column
	-compute for each cell score for d,v,o
	-add best to score matrix
	-check which score we added and add relative move to move matrix
	-return move and score matrix
-define alignment function
	-start from last row and column
	-create 2 empty string for aligmnet
	-get score
	-while we are not in the 1° cell
		-check corrisponding movement in the move matrix
		-align the residue as stated by the movement
	-revert 2 sequence
	-return alignment
-call matrix function
-call function to get alignment and score
-print them
